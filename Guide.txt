Hereâ€™s a rephrased version:

1. Create a virtual environment:  
   `python -m venv env`

2. Activate the environment:  
   `.\env\Scripts\activate`

3. Run the Streamlit app:  
   `streamlit run app.py`

4. To generate `requirements.txt`, run:  
   `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

To deploy:

1. Go to https://streamlit.io and sign in.
2. Open your GitHub account in parallel.
3. In GitHub, create a new public repository.
4. Push your code to the new GitHub repository.
5. Go back to Streamlit and click on "Deploy."
6. Paste the GitHub repository URL and the name of the main file (e.g., `app.py`).
7. Click on "Deploy" to publish your app.
